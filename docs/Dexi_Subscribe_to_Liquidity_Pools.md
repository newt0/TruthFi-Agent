## Subscribe to Liquidity Pools

Subscribing to a liquidity pool on Dexi allows you to unlock valuable insights, such as detailed analytics, candlestick charts, and liquidity information for the pool of your choice. Here is a step-by-step guide to subscribing to a liquidity pool:

####

1\. **Search for an Unsubscribed Pool**

To get started, you need to find a liquidity pool that hasn’t been subscribed to yet. Here's how:

- **Search by Name**: Use the search bar to type in the name of the pool you are interested in. Unsubscribed pools will appear with a slightly darker color to indicate that they haven't been subscribed to Dexi yet.
- **Search by Pool ID**: If you have the pool ID, you can paste it directly into the search bar to quickly locate the pool.
