The Agent Tab on Dexi

The **Agent Tab** on Dexi acts as a discovery hub and a seamless, plug-and-play interface for integrating agents into your projects. Think of agents as the equivalent of APIs in the Web 2.0 world: they provide specific functionalities that can be quickly integrated into applications with just a few clicks.

- **Agent Discovery**: If you're looking to enhance your application with new features, you can browse the Agent Tab to find pre-built agents that suit your needs. These agents are ready to be integrated and operate as autonomous processes, offering various functionalities within your app.
- **Agent Listing for Builders**: As a builder or product developer, you can list agents that operate within your app, allowing others to use these agents to extend their own applications. This opens up new opportunities for collaboration and functionality-sharing between developers.
- **Future Features**: The Agent Tab will evolve to include automatic agent composition, advanced metrics, and external funding options, further expanding the ways agents can be utilized and customized in applications.
