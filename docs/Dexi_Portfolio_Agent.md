üöÄ Spawning a Portfolio Agent

From the **My Portfolio** page, click on the clearly indicated **"Spawn Portfolio Agent"** button. This action will open a modal window allowing you to configure your new Portfolio Agent comprehensively.

![](https://docs.autonomous.finance/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F299217142-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fqi2z6qbW0AckrNyiYMEk%252Fuploads%252F5L18GXi9YtxHewEHudSv%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9a7614f5-1951-46ce-b0e8-2ba61e65cac3&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=42db9e28&sv=2)

####

‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Your Portfolio Agent

When the configuration modal opens, you will be asked for several key inputs:

- **Agent Name**: Give your agent a unique, easily identifiable name.
- **Quote Token**: Currently, AO is the default quote token used to value your portfolio. You can also use AR or other Assets as the Quote assets.
- **Portfolio Tokens**: Select at least two tokens to include in your agent's portfolio.

Once tokens are selected, Dexi automatically populates the available tokens list, clearly displaying:

- **Token Name**
- **Current Price**
- **Available Liquidity**

![](https://docs.autonomous.finance/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F299217142-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fqi2z6qbW0AckrNyiYMEk%252Fuploads%252FRcgUhTMQMxFGfEbboPws%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1b6c615f-1a36-41f5-8c22-0e68c0562c03&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=2130cd47&sv=2)

Initially, your portfolio allocation will be evenly distributed across selected tokens. Adjust individual allocations by changing percentages, instantly reflected visually in an interactive pie chart.

As you modify the token percentages:

- The pie chart dynamically updates, clearly illustrating your portfolio's composition.
- Each token's allocation can be precisely adjusted, providing granular control over your asset exposure.

####

üéöÔ∏è Deviation Percentage Explained

The **Deviation Percentage** allows the Portfolio Agent to determine permissible fluctuations away from the target asset allocations during active management.

For example:

- A **10% deviation** means:

  - A portfolio with **4 assets** allows each asset to deviate by approximately **¬±2.5%**.
  - A portfolio with **10 assets** means each asset deviates roughly **¬±1%**.

This flexible mechanism helps minimize unnecessary trading costs while maintaining portfolio balance efficiently.

üìå Slippage Tolerance

![](https://docs.autonomous.finance/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F299217142-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252Fqi2z6qbW0AckrNyiYMEk%252Fuploads%252F9QSWzN9yQVNsY66LsDOw%252Fimage.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D1b6abf6c-5c4d-4207-b7fd-c6b5d21ef8ce&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=b19e53ec&sv=2)

**Slippage Tolerance** defines the maximum acceptable price impact when your agent swaps tokens. This feature ensures your agent executes trades efficiently, balancing speed and cost-effectiveness.

- Dexi primarily supports Uniswap V2-type pools, meaning some price impact is inevitable.
- A **minimum of 5% slippage tolerance** is recommended, accommodating lower-liquidity pools effectively.
- When enabled, the agent always seeks the lowest possible price impact, ensuring optimal execution conditions for your portfolio.

---

####

üí∞ Funding & Spawning Your Agent

After configuring your asset selections, deviation, slippage tolerance, and reviewing your portfolio allocation:

1.  Enter the total **Investment Amount** in AO Tokens.
2.  Click **"Create"** to spawn your Portfolio Agent.

Upon creation, your funds are deployed, and the Portfolio Agent becomes an autonomous, active process within the AO ecosystem.

###

‚öôÔ∏è Managing Your Portfolio Agent

After deployment, Dexi provides intuitive controls to actively manage your Portfolio Agent directly through the user-friendly agent interface.
