All advanced order types on Botega are actually powered by Autonomous Agents. These are independent processes created specifically for the user, designed to interact with various systems such as oracles, liquidity pools, and more. These agents carry advanced logic, enabling features like trailing stops, risk assessments, and other sophisticated trading strategies.

The Limit Order tab allows you to easily create a limit order on Botega. This feature lets you set the price at which you want to buy or sell, and the order will only execute when the market reaches your specified price.

###

How to Use the Limit Order Feature on Botega

####

1\. Select Your Trading Tokens

- **Under "You Sell"**: Choose the token you want to sell by selecting it from the dropdown menu. Make sure you have enough balance to cover the trade.
- **Under "You Buy"**: Select the token you want to receive in return for your sale.

  Your current balance will be displayed in the interface for easy reference.

####

2\. Set the Limit Price

- **Set the Desired Price**: This is the price at which you want the trade to occur. Enter the price manually in the "Limit Price" field.
- **Use Price Adjustment Buttons**: You can also use the quick adjustment buttons (such as Market, -1%, -5%, -10%) to set the price relative to the current market value.
- The price will be expressed in the number of tokens you wish to receive for each unit of the token you're selling.

####

3\. Specify the Token Amount

- **Enter the Amount**: Input the number of tokens you wish to sell. You can manually type this in or use the quick percentage buttons like 25%, 50%, 75%, or MAX, which will automatically allocate portions of your total balance.

  The system will automatically calculate how many tokens you will receive based on your set limit price.

4\. Set Expiry Time (Optional)

- **Select Expiry Time**: Choose how long the limit order should remain active before expiring. You can select predefined timeframes such as 1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, or 3 days.

  If the market doesn't reach your limit price by the expiration time, the order will be canceled automatically.
