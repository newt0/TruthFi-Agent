## DCA Dollar Cost Averaging (Agents)

All advanced order types on Botega are actually powered by Autonomous Agents. These are independent processes created specifically for the user, designed to interact with various systems such as oracles, liquidity pools, and more. These agents carry advanced logic, enabling features like trailing stops, risk assessments, and other sophisticated trading strategies.

The DCA tab allows you to automate regular purchases of tokens on Botega. This feature helps you average your entry price over time by automatically executing trades at set intervals, reducing the impact of market volatility.
