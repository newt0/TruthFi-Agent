## Stamps

Stamps serve as the universal “like” button on the permaweb. With a [vouched wallet](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/), users can support content by stamping it, rewarding both content creators and stampers with $STAMP tokens daily. Essentially, you earn rewards for creating accessible content on the permaweb that the community appreciates and endorses.

###### $STAMP Token

Creators earn $STAMP tokens for creating quality content that users engage with. Learn more about the $STAMP token [here](https://stamps.arweave.net/#/en/stamp-token-1) and view your $STAMP holdings [here](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/asset/bLK9hMjx3jsJ4Ldjn-tvuTB1_PHzYV6ivPkv7_D8zKg). **Please note: Stamps on AO are experimental and will undergo changes.**
